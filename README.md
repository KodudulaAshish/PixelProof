Introduction:

This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs excel at processing image data by automatically learning hierarchical features, crucial for tasks like distinguishing "REAL" and "FAKE" images.

Motivation:

This project aims to provide a practical understanding of CNNs. CNNs offer automated feature extraction, learn complex patterns hierarchically, and are spatially invariant. Image classification with CNNs has applications in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, security, content moderation, and fake image detection.

Data:

The project uses a dataset of "REAL" and "FAKE" images, split into training and testing sets.

Implementation:

Key steps include data loading/preprocessing, CNN model architecture definition, model training, and performance evaluation.  TensorFlow/Keras and Matplotlib are used.

Future Improvements:

Potential improvements involve hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and using a validation set.

Conclusion:

This project practically applies CNNs to image classification, highlighting their effectiveness in computer vision.
